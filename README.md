# encore
Encore is a game where 2 teams compete to come up with songs with a designated word in the lyrics
Each round, one team will be given a word and 30 seconds to come up with a song containing that word
The team will need to sing 8 words of that song, including the designated word, before the timer runs out
If that team completes their turn, the opposing team will be given 30 seconds to come up with 8 words of a different song containing the designated word.
The round continues until one team fails to complete their turn. The next round starts with the opposing team.
The team that wins 10 rounds first wins the game.

The basic goal of this application is to create a single view with a textview that displays a randomly chosen word from a database, keeps track of points for both teams, and has a timer
For later iterations of the app, the goal will be to populate the database as each game starts with common words scraped from the top 100 list of songs on Spotify.
